# KuliKu Application For Consumen

A construction application that connects consumers who want to build a house, renovate a house, or things related to construction, with contractors consisting of coolies, foremen, and others.

## What is KuliKu?

## KuliKu is a start-up in Indonesia that focuses on the construction sector. KuliKu has a vision and mission to make it easier for consumers to carry out construction and renovations, as well as to make it easier for workers to find consumers.

# KuliKu Application Development Stage

Currently, the KuliKu application has not yet reached the production stage, but is still in the development stage. This application will continue to be updated and will be a fairly large application.

## KuliKu Application Development Process

Here I will try to describe some of the stages in making this big project.

1. UI/UX Design
   The design of this application was made by my colleague. He is [Fazry Rachman Susanto](https://www.behance.net/gallery/171186277/Case-Study_Construction-Mobile-App-KuliKu), a professional UI/UX designer.
2. Database Design
   Here I use a relational database in working on this project. The tool I use to make this design is draw.io

3. Create API
   For the Back-End section, I use the PHP programming language with the framework, namely Laravel. For Testing API I use Postman.
4. Create UI Aplication
   For the Front-End section, I use the Dart programming language with its framework, Flutter. The focus of this project is Android Applications.
5. Authentication
   For the authentication part, I use firebase to make Phone Verification.
