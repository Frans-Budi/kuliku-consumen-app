# KuliKu Application Development Stage

Currently, the KuliKu application has not yet reached the production stage, but is still in the development stage. This application will continue to be updated and will be a fairly large application.

## KuliKu Application Development Process

Here I will try to describe some of the stages in making this big project.

1. **UI/UX Design**

   The design of this application was made by my colleague. He is [Fazry Rachman Susanto](https://www.behance.net/gallery/171186277/Case-Study_Construction-Mobile-App-KuliKu), a professional UI/UX designer.

2. **Database Design**

   Here I use a relational database in working on this project. The tool I use to make this design is draw.io

3. **Create [API](https://github.com/Frans-Budi/kuliku-api)**

   For the Back-End section, I use the PHP programming language with the framework, namely Laravel. For Testing API I use Postman.

4. **Create UI Aplication**

   For the Front-End section, I use the Dart programming language with its framework, Flutter. The focus of this project is Android Applications.

5. **Authentication**

   For the authentication part, I use firebase to make Phone Verification.
